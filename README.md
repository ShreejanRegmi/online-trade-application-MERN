# online-trade-application

An online classified (e-commerce) app created using Node.js and React.  

Back end incorporates features such as REST API, jsonwebtokens for authentication, socket.io for real-time chat, nodemailer.

Front end uses React, Bootstrap CSS Framework, and React Context API for state management.

Application is built entirely by me from scratch by learning from youtube tutorials without using any sort of pre-made template.
